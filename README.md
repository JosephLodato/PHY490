# Syracuse PHY490 Independent Study Fall 2025 - Aperture Reconstruction

## Description
This project of this repository was the 'capstone' of this independent Study. This project reads in JPG images of a star with diffraction spikes and reconstructs the shape of the mirror used by the telescope. For example, feeding it an image of the JSWT's diffraction spikes will yield a hexagon mirror that will be reconstructed. This is done with the use of a Fourier transform, using a custom FFT algorithm by me. 


## Getting Started

### Dependencies
C++: Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., g++).
Python: Install Python 3. Ensure you have pip installed for managing Python dependencies:
 - NumPy and PIL

### Installing
1. Install Python libraries
(Assuming you have python3 and a C++ compiler already)
```
pip install pillow numpy
```

1. Clone the repository
```
git clone --branch <JWST-Mirror-Reconstruction> https://github.com/JosephLodato/PHY490
cd PHY490
```
2. Compile the C++ Code: Navigate to the cpp directory and compile the program:
```
cd cpp
g++ 2dFFT.c++ -o a.o
```
3. Set up Python Environment
```
cd ../python
pip install pillow numpy
```
### Executing program
1. Turn your image into a txt file
Note: if you want to change the name of the text file you also must to so in the 2dFFT.c++ file on line 288
```
python3 readImage.py [path of JPG] > img.txt
```
2. Run the C++ file along with reconstructAperture.py
```
./a.o | python3 reconstructAperture.py
```


## Help

### If you output geometry is not correct try the following:

#### 1. Make sure you image has the correct dimensions
Becusse of the way I wrote the FFT implementation, the size of the image dimensions must be a power of 2 (ex. 1024x2048). If you JPG image is not a power of 2, readImage.py will crop the image down automatically to the next lowest power of 2 for both X and Y, however, this might cut off large parts of your image!

#### 2. Change the spike cutoff threshold.
I was unable to make the C++ code automatically adjust the cut-off per image so I have a cut-off that worked well for me, but of course it likely won't work for all images. To adjust this cut off open up 2dFFT.c++ and adjust the double on line 252 until the correct number of spikes is detected.
```
                        â†“  it will be this number you need to adjust
double peakThreshold = 0.56 * *std::max_element(angleBins.begin(), angleBins.end());
```
